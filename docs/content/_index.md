Welcome to the official Docli documentation. This documentation will teach you how to use Docli on your next project.

## Organization

On the left side is a table of contents, organized into sections of related topics. Each topic will help you to understand a bit more about Docli.

**We recommend going through all the sections in a top-down approach.**

## Assumptions

To make the most out of the documentation you should have a working knowledge of:

- [Errors](https://gobyexample.com/errors)
- [Pointers](https://gobyexample.com/pointers)
- [Structs](https://gobyexample.com/structs)

## Reporting a problem

Typos, missing words, and code samples with errors are all considered documentation bugs. If you spot one of them or want to otherwise improve the existing guides, we are happy to help you help us!

Some of the more common ways to report a problem with the guides are:

- Using the **Edit this page** link on the bottom-right of each topic
- Opening an issue or pull request to [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/celicoo/docli)

Clicking the **Edit this page** link will bring you to GitHub's editor for that topic so you can edit right away, using the Markdown markup language. This is the fastest way to correct a typo, a missing word, or an error in a code sample.

If you wish to make a more significant contribution be sure to check our issue tracker to see if your issue is already being addressed. If you don't find an active issue, open a new one.

Many thanks for choosing Docli :heart:.
